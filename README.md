# Python Mini Projects
## Tracking My Python Journey Through Mini Projects

I started this journey already proficient in C++, so I started by familiarizing myself with the syntax of Python and then jumped straight into creating mini-projects.

_Please note that this is an unfinished repository, my progress slowed down as my new college semester started_

## Python Syntax
I familiarized myself with the syntax of Python through FreeCodeCamp's YouTube video [Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw?si=-VgRuiqxoZppwI9D)
as well as through solving coding problems on [Coddy.tech](https://coddy.tech/)

_(To get the best out of my daily limited code executions, I verified my solutions through ChatGPT first before submitting them on coddytech)_

## To-Do List
This was the first of the mini-projects, and it uses a command-line interface.
