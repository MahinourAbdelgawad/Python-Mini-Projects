# Python Mini Projects
## Tracking My Python Journey Through Mini Projects

I started this journey already proficient in C++, so I started by familiarizing myself with the syntax of Python and then jumped straight into creating mini-projects.

_Please note that this is an unfinished repository._

## Python Syntax
I familiarized myself with the syntax of Python through FreeCodeCamp's YouTube video [Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw?si=-VgRuiqxoZppwI9D)
as well as through solving coding problems on [Coddy.tech](https://coddy.tech/).  

_(To get the best out of my daily limited code executions, I verified my solutions through ChatGPT first before submitting them on coddytech)_

## [To-Do List](https://github.com/MahinourAbdelgawad/Python-Mini-Projects/tree/main/ToDo%20List%20CLI)
This was the first of the mini-projects, and it uses a command-line interface.  

  ### Features and Concepts Practiced/Learned
  1- User-defined classes.  
  2- Tabulate library for displaying to-do list.  
  3- Pickle files for saving to-do list.  
  4- Reading from and writing to files.  
  5- Controlling the command line (validating user input, clearing terminal, sleep function).  


## [Simple Calculator](https://github.com/MahinourAbdelgawad/Python-Mini-Projects/tree/main/Simple%20Calculator%20GUI)
This was the second of the mini-projects, but it was my first time experimenting with GUI for Python. For this project, I used Tkinter.  
Since it was my first time using Tkinter, I followed a tutorial by [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-simple-gui-calculator-using-tkinter/)

  ### Features and Concepts Practiced/Learned  
  1- Basic Tkinter features.  

## [YouTube Video Downloader](https://github.com/MahinourAbdelgawad/Python-Mini-Projects/tree/main/Simple%20Youtube%20Video%20Downloader%20Tkinter)  
This was the third of the mini-projects, and the second one using Tkinter.  
I followed a tutorial by [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-gui-for-downloading-youtube-video-using-python/)

  ### Features and Concepts Practiced/Learned
  1- Pytube/Pytubefix Libraries.*   
  2- Further familiarity with basic Tkinter features.  
  3- Threading (the program kept crashing without threading).  
  4- Handling download paths and searching for local directories.  

   *After hours of frustration and inability to make the program work, I discovered the issue was with the pytube library itself. After researching, I discovered an alternative library called [pytubefix](https://pypi.org/project/pytubefix/).  

I enjoyed this mini-project so much and decided to put the mini-projects roadmap on hold to work on a larger, more complex YouTube Video Downloader which also works for playlists _(in progress, repo is privated as of now)_

## [Simple Robot Arm Simulator](https://github.com/MahinourAbdelgawad/Python-Mini-Projects/tree/main/Simple%20Robot%20Arm%20Simulator)
With this project, I explored [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to simulate the movement of a robotic arm made up of 3 segments.

The program accepts user input to move any of the joints to a specified angle within the range of 0° to 180°.

### Features and Concepts Practiced/Learned
1- matplotlib library and interactive mode
2- Trigonometric calculations using math library
3- exception handling
